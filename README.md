This project demonstrates an LED follower circuit that uses a combination of a 555 Timer IC and a 74HC4017 Decade Counter IC. The circuit is designed to sequentially light up LEDs (SFH 4550) in response to an input trigger.

Below is a list of the primary components used in the circuit:

555 Timer IC (NE555P): Used in astable mode to generate clock pulses.

CD74HC4017 Decade Counter IC: A Johnson counter that drives LEDs sequentially based on input pulses.

SFH 4550 LEDs: Infrared LEDs for visualization and tracking functionality.

Resistors (R1, R2, R3): For controlling current flow and determining timing.

Capacitors (22 ÂµF): For stabilizing voltage and generating RC timing delays.

Switches and Connectors: For input control and power connections.

Power Source: Provides the required voltage (5V DC)
